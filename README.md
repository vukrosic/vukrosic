### Hi there 👋  

#### 🤖 AI Models

Tiny, honest, code-trained models — each does one narrow thing a script can't, runs on a CPU in milliseconds, and ships with its own benchmark, tests, and technical report.

- **[nano-g2p](https://github.com/vukrosic/nano-g2p)** — spells out how a word is pronounced (`though` → `DH OW`, `tough` → `T AH F`, `through` → `TH R UW`), the mapping English spelling rules genuinely can't compute — and it generalises to words it never saw: 72.1% vs 8.4% for a per-letter "sound it out" script (on held-out words). A ~1M-param byte-level transformer trained on a frozen public lexicon. → [model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/vukrosic/nano-g2p)
- **[nano-spell](https://github.com/vukrosic/nano-spell)** — corrects a misspelled word to the word it meant (`recieve` → `receive`, `thier` → `their`), where nearest-dictionary-by-edit-distance keeps snapping to the wrong word — 86.8% vs a frequency dictionary's 73.7% (68.7% vs 29.8% on the hard slice). A ~1M-param byte-level transformer trained 100% on code-generated data. → [model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/vukrosic/nano-spell)
- **[nano-vowel](https://github.com/vukrosic/nano-vowel)** — restores the vowels to a vowel-less word (`wrld` → `world`, `brd` → `bread`), the inverse of a lossy map no rule can compute — 84.7% vs a naive script's 68.7%. A ~1M-param byte-level transformer trained 100% on code-generated data. → [model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/vukrosic/nano-vowel)
- **[nano-case](https://github.com/vukrosic/nano-case)** — converts messy, separator-less identifiers like `sdkmodel` or `HTTPREQUESTHANDLER` into any case style (snake/kebab/camel/pascal/const) — the slice a regex provably can't split (99.7% vs 8.2%). A ~1M-param byte-level transformer trained 100% on code-generated data. → [model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/vukrosic/nano-case)
- **[nano-dates](https://github.com/vukrosic/nano-dates)** — turns natural date phrases like "next friday" or "third thursday of march" into ISO-8601 dates, with an honest map of where it breaks. A ~1M-param byte-level transformer trained 100% on code-generated data. → [model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/vukrosic/nano-dates)
